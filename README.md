# Shiny-Apps
Shiny (R) Apps- spun from my FieldProcessing Repo

Specific to Shiny Apps (Jess Sullivan) for deployment on AWS Ubuntu

Services with minimal UI:
#
"clean" - Point Count Data Cleaning Template
#
Centroid_KML - "KML-Centroid-Generator" 
#
KML2CSV - converts KML (XML) to .csv spreadsheet format
#
KMLSubsetFilter - from a KML file, this tool returns a subset KML based on two query strings (searches the description field of the KML)
#
# These are live (9.12.18) at http://kml.jessdev.org on an AWS Ubuntu shiny server
