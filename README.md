# Visit /[Flask_Manager](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/Shiny-Apps/tree/master/Flask_Manager) :  Manage multiple single-thead web applications with Flask


Visit the [single threaded example here](https://kml-tools.herokuapp.com/); (Not load balanced.)  These are wrapped in a Node.JS application on Heroku, which loads each utility through [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).  These functions are hosted entirely through (Heroku / shinyapps) free tiers.  (direct link: https://kml-tools.herokuapp.com/)
#
Visit /[Docker-App](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/Shiny-Apps/tree/master/Docker-App) for deployment in the GCP app engine; multi-user loads are percolating there.
